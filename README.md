# World_Weather_Analysis

## API Overview
The purpose of this project is to pull weather data from OpenWeatherMap using APIs by parsing weather data for 2000 unique coordinates. In doing so, we were able to capture specific data points such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and also a current description of the weather for all locations. vicinity.

We took it a step further and allowed the user to select their preferred temperature range, find locations within that range, and even created a vacation itinerary based on locations within a similar. We were able to do this by using Google's Directions API to help determine the distance between four separate locations. The four cities used in this project can be found along the coast of Brazil!
